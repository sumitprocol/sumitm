    - Teach "connection and extension"
    - Make your expectations and metrics of competence that you demand in action and attitudes from personnel the new reality of organisation 
- Like water most individuals seek lower ground if left to their own inclinations. In most cases you're the one who inspires and demands they go upward rather than settle for the comfort of doing what comes easily. Push them beyond their comfort zone, expect them to give extra effort 
- Bill was very demanding in all aspects. He had written a series of lectures for each department detailing what he expected in all ways - appearance, attitude, performance and more. He had it written out for scouts, assistant coaches, groundskeepers etc. 
- Bill had setup an outstanding support mechanism for talented people, and he really had nothing to worry about except football.
- There was intensity and urgency, a focus all the time, a tight ship. He was friendly, but he held himself in a certain manner so that you know he was in charge
- **Bill had an exceptional eye for Talent**
- Lessons from Bill Walsh Offense
    - Success doesn't care which road you take to get to its doorstep 
    - Be Bold, Remove fear of the unknown - that is, change - from your mind 
    - Desperation should not drive innovation - 
        - ^^What assets do we have right now that we're not taking advantage of?^^
    - Be obsessive in looking for upside in the downside 
        - Instead of looking for reasons that we couldn't make it, instead seek solutions that would make it success 
- Unfortunately, too often we find comfort in what worked before - even when it stops working. We get stuck there and resist the new, the unfamiliar, the unconventional 
- Share the Glory - Few things offer greater return on less investment than praise - offering credit to someone in your organisation who has stepped up and done the job
- Write your own script for success
    - Contingency planning is critical for a company and is a primary responsibility of a leadership team. You must continuously be anticipating and preparing to deal with what management expert Peter Drucker calls "Foul Weather". He viewed it as most important job of leadership. 
    - Having a well thought out plan ready to go in advance of a change in the weather is the key to success. I came to understand this when I realised that making decisions off the top of my head was a recipe for a bad decisions - especially under pressure. 
    - Scripting is the most effective leadership tool in fair and foul weather. I a very calculated way, I began calling the plays for the game before the game was played. I took years for other teams to fully implement the concepts I had been developing for a long time
    - You must envision the future deeply and in detail creatively - so that the unforeseeable become foreseeable. Then you write the script for the foreseeable. 
    - Developing the plays may have taken more energy from me than the game, but once the scripting was complete, I felt we could breathe easier, now all we had to do was perform. 
    - Michael Ovitz, president of walt disney company, recognized the link between scripting and success: "Every detail is important. Where do you have a meeting? What is the surrounding environment? People who don't think about these things have a harder time in business. It's got to be the right place. It's got to be the right color. It's got to be the right choice. Everything has to be strategised. 
    - The military is known for doing this - war gaming, thinking through its response to all contingencies. The more thorough, the more extensive, the more rehearsed, the better your perform under the pressure of any situation that calls for an immediate decision. 
    - What is the width and depth of the intellect you've applied to your own team's contingency planning?
- Be a leader - Twelve habits + 1 
    - Defining characteristic of a good leader is the conviction that he or she can make a positive difference - can prevail even when the odds are stacked against him or her. A successful leader is not easily swayed from this self-belief. But it happens. 
    - ^^Be Yourself^^ - You must be the best version of yourself that you can be, stay within the framework of your own personality and be authentic. If you're faking it you'll be found out. 
    - ^^Be committed to excellence^^ - At all times, in all ways, your focus must be on the doing things at the best possible level. 
    - Be positive 
    - Be organised - Great organisation is the trademark of a great organisation. You must think clearly with a disciplined mind, especially in regard to the most efficient and productive use of time and resources. 
    - Be accountable - Excuse making is contagious. 
    - Be near-sighted and far-sighted - Keep everything in perspective while simultaneously concentrating fully on the task at hand. ^^All the decisions should be made with an eye toward how they affect the organisation.^^ All efforts and plans should be considered not only in terms of short-run effect, but also in terms of how they impact the organisation in long term. This is very difficult. 
    - Be fair - Your value system is as important to success as your expertise. ^^Be clear in your own mind as to what you stand for. And then stand up for it. ^^
    - Be firm - I would not budge one inch on my core values, standards, and principles. 
    - Be flexible - Be agile in adapting to changing circumstances. 
    - Believe in yourself - To a large degree a leader must sell itself to the team. This is impossible unless you exhibit self confidence.
